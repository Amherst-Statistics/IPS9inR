## Introduction and background 

These documents are intended to help describe how to undertake analyses introduced 
as examples in the Ninth Edition of \emph{Introduction to the Practice of Statistics} (2017) by Moore, McCabe, and Craig.

More information about the book can be found [here](https://macmillanlearning.com/Catalog/product/introductiontothepracticeofstatistics-ninthedition-moore).
The data used in these documents can be found under Data Sets in the [Student Site](https://www.macmillanlearning.com/catalog/studentresources/ips9e?_ga=2.29224888.526668012.1531487989-1209447309.1529940008#). This
file as well as the associated R Markdown reproducible analysis source file used to create it can be found at https://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/ips9/.

This work leverages initiatives undertaken by Project MOSAIC (http://www.mosaic-web.org), an NSF-funded effort to improve the teaching of statistics, calculus, science and computing in the undergraduate curriculum. In particular, we utilize the `mosaic` package, which was written to simplify the use of R for introductory statistics courses. A short summary of the R needed to teach introductory statistics can be found in the mosaic package vignettes (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic).  A paper describing the mosaic approach was published in the *R Journal*: https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-024.
  
## Chapter 11: Multiple Regression
This file replicates the analyses from Chapter 11: Multiple Regression.

First, load the packages that will be needed for this document: 

```{r load-packages}
library(mosaic)
library(readr)
```

### Section 11.1: Inference for multiple regression

#### Example 11.1: Predicting early success in college

```{r eg11-1, message=FALSE}
GPA <- read_csv("https://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/ips9/data/chapter11/EG11-01GPA.csv")
# Figure 11.1, page 609
head(GPA)
```

### Section 11.2: A Case Study

```{r}
# Figure 11.2, page 619
favstats(~ GPA, data = GPA)
favstats(~ HSM, data = GPA)
favstats(~ HSS, data = GPA)
favstats(~ HSE, data = GPA)
favstats(~ SATM, data = GPA)
favstats(~ SATCR, data = GPA)
favstats(~ SATW, data = GPA)
```

```{r}
# Figure 11.3, page 620
gf_histogram(~ HSM, data = GPA) %>%
  gf_labs(y = "Percent")# Doesn't look great
gf_histogram(~ HSS, data = GPA) %>%
  gf_labs(y = "Percent")
gf_histogram(~ HSE, data = GPA) %>%
  gf_labs(y = "Percent")
```

#### Relationships between pairs of variables

```{r}
# Figure 11.4, page 621
options(digits = 2)
cor(GPA)
```

#### Example 11.13: Pairwise relationships among variables in the GPA data set

```{r}
GPA <- read_csv("https://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/ips9/data/chapter11/EX11-13GPA.csv")
library(GGally)
# Figure 11.5
GGally::ggpairs(GPA)
```

#### Regression on high school grades

```{r}
# Figure 11.6, page 623
```
