## Introduction and background 

These documents are intended to help describe how to undertake analyses introduced 
as examples in the Ninth Edition of \emph{Introduction to the Practice of Statistics} (2017) by Moore, McCabe, and Craig.

More information about the book can be found [here](https://macmillanlearning.com/Catalog/product/introductiontothepracticeofstatistics-ninthedition-moore).
The data used in these documents can be found under Data Sets in the [Student Site](https://www.macmillanlearning.com/catalog/studentresources/ips9e?_ga=2.29224888.526668012.1531487989-1209447309.1529940008#). This
file as well as the associated R Markdown reproducible analysis source file used to create it can be found at https://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/ips9/.

This work leverages initiatives undertaken by Project MOSAIC (http://www.mosaic-web.org), an NSF-funded effort to improve the teaching of statistics, calculus, science and computing in the undergraduate curriculum. In particular, we utilize the `mosaic` package, which was written to simplify the use of R for introductory statistics courses. A short summary of the R needed to teach introductory statistics can be found in the mosaic package vignettes (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic).  A paper describing the mosaic approach was published in the *R Journal*: https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-024.
  
## Chapter 8: Inference for Proportions
This file replicates the analyses from Chapter 8: Inference for Proportions.

First, load the packages that will be needed for this document: 
```{r load-packages}
library(mosaic)
library(readr)
```

### Section 8.1: Inference for a single proportion 
```{r eg8-1, message=FALSE}
ROBOT <- read_csv("https://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/ips9/data/chapter08/EG08-01ROBOT.csv")
ROBOT
### Example 8.2, page 487
binom.test(910, 910 + 986, 
           alternative="two.sided",
           conf.level=0.95)
```
By default, the `read_csv()` function will output the types of columns, as we see above. 
To improve readability for future coding, we will suppress the "Parsed with column 
specification" message by adding `message = FALSE` at the top of the code chunks.

```{r eg8-5, message=FALSE}
SUNBL <- read_csv("https://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/ips9/data/chapter08/EG08-05SUNBL.csv")
### Example 8.5 and 8.6, page 492-493
binom.test(13, 20, alternative = "two.sided")
## XX The p value is not 0.1802 as the book reports 
```

```{r eg8-11, message=FALSE}
INSTAG <- read_csv("https://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/ips9/data/chapter08/EG08-11INSTAG.csv")
### Example 8.11, page 507
INSTAG_prop <- INSTAG %>%
  group_by(Sex) %>%
  mutate(Prop_by_Sex = Count/sum(Count)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(User == "Yes")
INSTAG_prop

### Example 8.15, page 513
prop.test(x = c(328, 234), n = c(537, 532), correct = FALSE)

### Example 8.16, page 515
zstar = qnorm(.975) # for 95% confidence interval
p = 0.5 # planned proportion estimate
moe = 0.1 # margin of error
p*(zstar/moe)^2 
### Example 8.17, page 516
## XX unknown power plot

```

### Section 8.2: Comparing two proportions
