This work leverages initiatives undertaken by [Project MOSAIC](http://www.mosaic-web.org/), an NSF-funded effort to improve the teaching of statistics, calculus, science and computing in the undergraduate curriculum. In particular, we utilize the `mosaic` package, which was written to simplify the use of R for introductory statistics courses (see [https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-024](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-024) for more details). A short summary of the R needed to teach introductory statistics can be found in the [mosaic package vignettes](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic). A description of mosaic resources can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic/vignettes/mosaic-resources.html).
